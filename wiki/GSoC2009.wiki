#summary Home page for GSoC 2009 project on OpenCL implementation of beagle-lib.

== Introduction ==

As part of the Google Summer of Code 2009 program, Daniel Ayres will implement an OpenCL version of beagle-lib.

== Project Plan ==

=== 05/23 - 05/30 ===

 * Begin porting of current beagle-lib to CUDA driver API
 * Discuss additional interface necessary for other phylogenetic software (as part of the likelihood API meeting at Maryland)

=== 05/30 - 06/06 ===

 * Finish porting of current beagle-lib to CUDA driver API
 * Begin work on describing additional interface necessary for GARLI
 * Begin work on OpenCL implementation


=== 06/06 - 06/13 ===

 * Finish description of additional interface necessary for GARLI
 * Continue work on OpenCL implementation

== Deliverables ==

=== 06/06 ===

 * CUDA driver API port of beagle-lib

=== 06/13 ===

 * GARLI interface description

=== 08/23 ===
 * OpenCL implementation of beagle-lib

== Decision Discussion ==

=== Convert beagle-lib CUDA implementation to CUDA Driver API ===

Although the driver API is more complex, it will allow for much easier transition to OpenCL. And, since we intend to maintain both CUDA and OpenCL implementations of beagle-lib, it makes sense for these to be as similar as possible.
