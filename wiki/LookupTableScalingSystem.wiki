#summary Suggestion for a low memory scaling system

Pre-calculate a fixed set of N scaling factors (and their log values) in a look up table. The exponent range for single precision is [âˆ’126, 127] so with N = 254 all exponents are accommodated. The values would be the exponents that would normalize the number to an exponent of zero. When rescaling a set of partials, the entry in the look up table would be selected that normalizes the largest value and the entry value used to scale the partials. The index of this entry would then be used to increment a count in the N-length vector of integer weights associated with the partials. These counts can be accumulated across all partials and then multiplied by the log scale factors to obtain the final log scaling factor. This results in a single N integer vector per partials array.
