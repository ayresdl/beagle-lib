===Installing BEAGLE on Windows===
The easiest way to install BEAGLE is to use the binary installer.

*Step 1.* Download and run the binary installer:
  * [http://beagle-lib.googlecode.com/files/BEAGLE-1.0.msi BEAGLE-1.0.msi]

*Step 2.* If you wish to use BEAGLE with an NVIDIA GPU please download and install the latest NVIDIA drivers for your graphics card from nvidia.com:
  * [http://www.nvidia.com/page/drivers.html NVIDIA Driver Downloads]

After the installations above are complete, restart your computer and you will be ready to use BEAGLE with compatible applications such as BEAST, MrBayes, and GARLI. 

For instructions on how to use BEAGLE with BEAST please refer to [http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/BEAGLE Using BEAGLE with BEAST]

====Installing from source====
If you have problems with the binary installer or wish to use the very latest SVN revision you may build BEAGLE from source.

The following software prerequisites must be installed prior to building libhmsbeagle on Windows:

  * A 64-bit Windows OS (XP or later)
  * Visual Studio Professional 2008 (express edition will not work)
  * Java Development Kit 1.5 or later
  * NVIDIA CUDA toolkit
  ** The video card driver is required to use the library, but not to build it

*Step 1.* Checkout the source code repository:
{{{
svn co http://beagle-lib.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ beagle-lib
}}}

*Step 2.* Configure your Java path by navigating to `project\beagle-vs` and running `findJava.bat`

*Step 3.* Open the Visual Studio 2008 project:
  * It's located at `project\beagle-vs\libhmsbeagle_vc90.sln`

*Step 4.* Set the configuration to `Release|x64` and build the solution (`Build -> Build Solution`)

*Step 5.* Set the configuration to `Release|Win32` and build the solution (`Build -> Build Solution`)

*Step 6.* Right-click on the `hmsbeagle library` installer project (at the left hand side in the project explorer) and select `build`

*Step 7.* The installer will be located in `project\beagle-vs\beagleinstaller\Release`, assuming a release build.  Note that if error messages appear that the build system was unable to find Java, then you must build from the command line with `build_installer.bat`.  See below.

*Alternate approach:*  Edit the file `project\beagle-vs\build_installer.bat` to point to the Visual Studio installation, and run it.  Skip steps 2-6.
