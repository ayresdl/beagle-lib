===Installing BEAGLE on Windows===
The easiest way to install BEAGLE is to use the binary installer.

*Step 1.* Download and run the binary installer:
  * [http://beagle-lib.googlecode.com/files/BEAGLE-1.0.msi BEAGLE-1.0.msi]

*Step 2.* If you wish to use BEAGLE with an NVIDIA GPU please download and install the latest NVIDIA drivers for your graphics card from nvidia.com:
  * [http://www.nvidia.com/page/drivers.html NVIDIA Driver Downloads]

After the installations above are complete you will be ready to use BEAGLE with compatible applications such as BEAST, MrBayes, and GARLI.

====Installing from source====
If you have problems with the binary installer or wish to use the very latest SVN revision you may build BEAGLE from source.

The following software prerequisites must be installed prior to building libhmsbeagle on Windows:

  * A 64-bit Windows OS (XP or later)
  * Visual Studio Professional 2008 (express edition will not work)
  * Java Development Kit 1.5 or later
  * NVIDIA CUDA toolkit
  ** The video card driver is required to use the library, but not to build it

*Step 1.* Checkout the source code repository:
{{{
svn co http://beagle-lib.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ beagle-lib
}}}

*Step 2.* Open the Visual Studio 2008 project:
  * It's located at project\beagle-vs\libhmsbeagle_vc90.sln

*Step 3.* Set the desired configuration (e.g. "Release" and X64)

*Step 4.* Right-click on the installer project (at the left hand side in the project explorer) and select "build"

*Step 5.* The installer will be located in project\beagle-vs\beagleinstaller\Release, assuming a release build.  Note that if error messages appear that the build system was unable to find Java, then you must build from the command line with build_installer.bat.  See below.

*Alternate approach:*  Edit the file project\beagle-vs\build_installer.bat to point to the Visual Studio and ant installations, and run it from within a command prompt.  Skip steps 2-4.
