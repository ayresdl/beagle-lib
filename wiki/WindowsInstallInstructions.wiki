===Installing BEAGLE on Windows===
The easiest way to install BEAGLE is to use the binary installer.

*Step 1.* Download and run the binary installer:
  * [http://beagle-lib.googlecode.com/files/BEAGLE-1.0.msi BEAGLE-1.0.msi]

*Step 2.* If you wish to use BEAGLE with an NVIDIA GPU please download and install the latest NVIDIA drivers for your graphics card from nvidia.com:
  * [http://www.nvidia.com/page/drivers.html NVIDIA Driver Downloads]

After the installations above are complete, restart your computer and you will be ready to use BEAGLE with compatible applications such as BEAST, MrBayes, and GARLI. 

For instructions on how to use BEAGLE with BEAST please refer to [http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/BEAGLE Using BEAGLE with BEAST]

====Installing from source====
If you have problems with the binary installer or wish to use the very latest SVN revision you may build BEAGLE from source.

The following software prerequisites must be installed prior to building libhmsbeagle on Windows:

  * Visual Studio 2012
  * Java Development Kit 1.6 or later
  * Intel OpenCL SDK (if you wish to build the OpenCL plugin)

*Step 1.* Obtain a subversion client (such as [http://tortoisesvn.net TortoiseSVN]) and checkout the source code from the repository: 
{{{
http://beagle-lib.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
}}}

*Step 2.* Configure your Java path by navigating to *`project\beagle-vs-2012`* and running *`findJava.bat`*.

*Step 3.* Open the Visual Studio 2012 project located at *`project\beagle-vs-2012\libhmsbeagle.sln`*.

*Step 4.* Set the configuration to *`Release|x64`* or *`Release|Win32`* and build the following projects within the solution:
{{{
	libhmsbeagle
	libhmsbeagle-cpu
	libhmsbeagle-opencl
}}}

*Step 5.* The previus step will create three *`hmsbeagle*.dll`* files located at *`project\beagle-vs-2012\x64\Release`* or *`project\beagle-vs-2012\Release`*. Copy these *`hmsbeagle*.dll`* files to the directory of the application you want to use with BEAGLE.
