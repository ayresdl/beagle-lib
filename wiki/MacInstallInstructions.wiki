===Installing BEAGLE on Mac OS X===
The easiest way to install BEAGLE is to use the binary installer. This installation should work with Mac OS X v10.5 (Leopard) and v10.6 (Snow Leopard).

*Step 1.* Download and run the binary installer:
  * [http://beagle-lib.googlecode.com/files/BEAGLE-1.0.pkg BEAGLE-1.0.pkg]

*Step 2.* If you wish to use BEAGLE with an NVIDIA GPU please download and install the latest NVIDIA CUDA drivers for Mac OS from nvidia.com:
  * [http://www.nvidia.com/object/mac-driver-archive.html NVIDIA CUDA drivers for Mac]

After the installations above are complete you will be ready to use BEAGLE with compatible applications such as BEAST, MrBayes, and GARLI. 

For instructions on how to use BEAGLE with BEAST please refer to [http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/BEAGLE Using BEAGLE with BEAST]

====Installing from source====
If you have problems with the binary installer or wish to use the very latest SVN revision you may build BEAGLE from source.

*Step 1.* You will need to install Xcode, which includes Apple's developer tools. Xcode can be found on your Mac OS X install disk as an optional installation (look for 'Xcode'). You can also download Xcode from  [https://connect.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MemberSite.woa/wa/getSoftware?bundleID=20792 connect.apple.com ] (free registration required) or purchase it on the [http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id422352214?mt=12 Mac App Store].

*Step 2.* To use BEAGLE with NVIDIA graphics cards you will need to download and install the  [http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html CUDA drivers and tools from nvidia.com]. Select "Mac OS" as the Operating System and then select the 'Developer Drivers for MacOS' package. You will also need to download and install the 'CUDA Toolkit' package.

*Step 3.* Next you will need to download and install BEAGLE. Open 'Terminal.app' and type:
{{{
svn checkout http://beagle-lib.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ beagle-lib
}}} 
This will download BEAGLE into a folder called 'beagle-lib'.

*Step 4.* Type:
{{{
cd beagle-lib
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
}}}
You will have to type your admin password in for the last of these commands. 

*Step 5.* Finally, to check that the installation worked and that your NVIDIA card is working type:
{{{
make check
}}}
This will run a suite of test programs using the BEAGLE library.
