===Installing BEAGLE on Mac OS X===
The easiest way to install BEAGLE is to use the binary installer. This installation should work with Mac OS X v10.5 (Leopard) and v10.6 (Snow Leopard).

*Step 1.* Download and run the binary installer:
  * [http://beagle-lib.googlecode.com/files/BEAGLE-1.0.pkg BEAGLE-1.0.pkg]

*Step 2.* If you have OS X v10.6 or later and wish to use BEAGLE with an NVIDIA GPU please download and install the latest NVIDIA CUDA drivers for Mac OS from nvidia.com:
  * [http://www.nvidia.com/object/mac-driver-archive.html NVIDIA CUDA drivers for Mac]

After the installations above are complete you will be ready to use BEAGLE with compatible applications such as BEAST, MrBayes, and GARLI. 

For instructions on how to use BEAGLE with BEAST please refer to [http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/BEAGLE Using BEAGLE with BEAST]

====Installing from source====
If you have problems with the binary installer or wish to use the very latest SVN revision you may build BEAGLE from source.

*Step 1.* You will need to install Xcode, which includes Apple's developer tools. You can download Xcode from the [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835 Mac App Store].

*Step 2. (optional)* To use BEAGLE with CUDA for NVIDIA graphics cards you will need to download and install the [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads CUDA Toolkit for Mac OS X from nvidia.com]. You will also need to download and install the standalone version of the [https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?q=command%20line%20tools Command Line Tools for Xcode from developer.apple.com] (you will need a free Apple developer account for this download).

*Step 3.* Next you will need to download the BEAGLE source code. Open 'Terminal.app' and type:
{{{
svn checkout http://beagle-lib.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ beagle-lib
}}} 
This will download the BEAGLE source into a folder called 'beagle-lib'.

*Step 4.* The next step is to compile the BEAGLE library. Type:
{{{
cd beagle-lib
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
}}}
You will have to enter your user password for the last of these commands. 

*Step 5.* Finally, to check that the installation worked type:
{{{
make check
}}}
This will run a suite of test programs using the BEAGLE library.
