Proposed changes:
  * Add auto-scale and always-scale flags to beagle
  ** auto-scale should report back its scaling method at initialization
  ** initial auto-scale implementation will be equivalent to always-scale
  ** later implementation would involve check for a threshold value which would trigger rescaling

  * Break up *beagleCalculateRootLogLikelihoods* and *beagleCalculateEdgeLogLikelihoods* so that *inWeights* and *inStateFrequencies* are set in separate calls

Discuss further:

  * Have  *beagleCalculateRootLogLikelihoods* and *beagleCalculateEdgeLogLikelihoods*  optionally return the total likelihood and derivatives
