Proposed changes:
  * Add auto-scale and always-scale flags to beagle
    * auto-scale should report back its scaling method at *beagleInitializeInstance* via *BeagleInstanceDetails*
    * initial auto-scale implementation will be equivalent to always-scale
    * later implementation would involve check for a threshold value which would trigger rescaling

  * Break up *beagleCalculateRootLogLikelihoods* and *beagleCalculateEdgeLogLikelihoods* so that *inWeights* and *inStateFrequencies* are set in separate calls

Specific proposed changes to API:

Add flags to BeagleFlags enum:

    BEAGLE_FLAG_AUTO_SCALE = 1 << 6,    /**< beagle autoscaling on */
    BEAGLE_FLAG_ALWAYS_SCALE = 1 <<7,    /**< beagle scales at every update */

Change to contract for 'beagleCreateInstance':
 * @param scaleBufferCount		Number of scale buffers to create, ignored for auto scale or always scale (input)

Discuss further:

  * Have  *beagleCalculateRootLogLikelihoods* and *beagleCalculateEdgeLogLikelihoods*  optionally return the total likelihood and derivatives
